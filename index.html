        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p> Smt. Kothai Rajan will be teaching all the classes. Kothai started her musical and dance
            career at the young age of six by learning bharathanatyam. Then, when she was eight years old, she started
            learning veena from Dr. Mrs. "Kalasuri" Arunthathi Sriranganathan whose career was with the Sri Lanka
            Broadcasting Corporation, which exposed Kothai to Hindustani and Western musical genres. Kothai has
            performed with her guru innumerable times during stage, radio, and television programmes including the
            Thyagaraja Uthchavem and Sarasaveya Film Festival. She also completed her teacher's certification from
            North Ceylon Musical Academy. Meanwhile, she also learned jaladarangam from Mrs. Sundararani Chandrakumar
            and completed fifth grade in that instrument. Later, she learnt keyboards from Mr. A. Mahendran, because
            of her desire to venture beyond Carnatic music. Consequently, her veena-playing combines Carnatic and
            Western musical styles.

            music and instruments. She also prepares her students for piano, guitar and Western violin exams from the
            Royal Conservatory School of Music. Kothai coaches her students both practical and theory according to the
            relevant curriculum Moreover, she is an accredited iSCORE piano teacher affiliated with Queen's University
            and the RCM Board. She contributed her time and musical expertise to the iSCORE Pilot Research Project

            Kothai has given numerous Carnatic and western music programs in many cultural, religious and community
            events all over GTA as solo performances as well as ensembles with her students. She has produced many
            young talents in the field of music over the past years and has been continuously upgrading the quality of
            her teaching techniques by adopting new technological developments in music. She customizes her coaching
            style to suit each individual student's skills, potential and interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her school conducts an annual show to highlight the talents of the young musicians she teaches. As passion
            for music is instilled by the guru to the student, Kothai's passion for music is transferred to her
            students and is evident during her numerous stage performances. Her dedication to her students fosters a
            learning environment that helps them grow in many facets of their lives.
